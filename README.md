Tools & Tech: Figma, React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
Project Duration: 2 weeks

🧾 Project Summary
OneBite Pizza, a modern pizza delivery brand, needed a responsive and visually appetizing homepage. The goal was to craft an engaging digital experience that showcases their offerings while maintaining a balance of performance, usability, and aesthetic appeal. As both UI/UX designer and front-end developer, I led the entire process—from wireframes to live UI components.

🎯 Goals & Strategy
Create a bold, appetizing design that resonates with hungry users.

Streamline navigation to key content areas: hero section, combo offers, full menu, reviews, and footer.

Ensure responsiveness across devices from mobile to desktop.

Focus on speed and optimization, using utility-first CSS and lightweight assets.

Comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), ensuring inclusive design for all users.

🔍 Research & Discovery
To inform the design direction, I conducted:

Competitive analysis of industry leaders like Domino’s and Pizza Hut to understand trends, user flow, and content strategies.

User surveys that gathered insights about preferred CTA placements, layout expectations, and mobile usability.

Visual exploration, inspired by warm, flavorful tones (e.g., OneBite Yellow), playful fonts, and mouthwatering food photography.

🧱 Information Architecture
The homepage layout was structured with clarity and hierarchy:

Header: Includes logo, navigation links, cart icon, and login button.

Hero Section: Features a bold headline, subtext, search/location input, and a prominent food visual with overlay callouts.

Special Combos: A 3-tier pricing card section for S/M/L pizzas with prominent order buttons.

Newsletter Call-to-Action: Captures user emails with an incentive-based message.

Pizza Menu Carousel: Scrollable cards displaying popular menu items with images and interaction icons.

Customer Testimonials: Quotes, avatars, and reviews to build credibility and community.

Footer: Includes newsletter opt-in, navigation links, branding, contact info, and social media icons.

✏️ Design Process
Wireframes & Prototyping
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Rough sketches to validate content and structure for both desktop and mobile.

Mid-Fidelity Mockups: Developed in Figma to refine spacing, layout, and alignment.

High-Fidelity Prototypes: Final interactive flows presented with polished typography, visuals, and spacing for stakeholder approval.

🎨 Visual Design System
Color Palette

Color Name	Hex	Usage
OneBite Yellow	#FFC107	CTAs, highlights
Dark Charcoal	#212121	Text, background contrast
White	#FFFFFF	Backgrounds, text
Light Gray	#F5F5F5	Section background accents
Typography
Headings: Playfair Display, serif — used boldly for titles and headlines.

Body Text: System default sans‑serif stack (Inter, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, etc.) — chosen for performance and cross-platform consistency.

Font Strategy: To boost loading performance and reduce flash of invisible text (FOIT), the project primarily used system fonts for general content and applied font-display: swap for custom headings.

Imagery & Iconography
High-resolution, naturally lit pizza photos

Whimsical illustrated doodles as background accents

Custom-designed icons for navigation, cart, and search interactions

🧩 Component-Based Architecture
Reusable components were built in React and styled using Tailwind CSS:

Layout Elements: Header, Footer, NavItem, Button, IconButton

Hero Section: HeroBanner, LocationInput, SearchBar, BadgeCallout

Offers & Menu: CardCombo, ComboPriceTag, OrderButton, CardMenuItem, ReadMoreIcon, Carousel

User Engagement: NewsletterForm, InputField, SubscribeButton, Testimonial, AvatarCircle, QuoteIcon

📱 Responsive Design Approach
Tailwind’s responsive utility classes enabled flexible layouts for every screen size:

Mobile: Collapsible nav menu, vertical stacking, touch-friendly UI

Tablet: Grid-based section layouts, horizontal scroll for carousels

Desktop: Full-width hero image, multi-column layout, persistent navigation bar

Techniques like sm:, md:, and lg: classes in Tailwind were used alongside CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout responsiveness.

🛠️ Development & Optimization
Framework: React (Vite for faster builds)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (PostCSS integration)

State Management: Local state with React hooks (e.g., for carousels)

Asset Handling: Images in WebP format, lazy-loaded with loading="lazy"

Code Quality Tools: ESLint, Prettier, modular folder structure (components/, assets/, styles/)

⚡ Performance & Accessibility
Lighthouse Performance Score: >90 on Desktop

Load Time: <3s on 3G connections

Accessibility Highlights:

Semantic HTML5 structure

Alt text for images

ARIA roles for interactive components

Color contrast maintained at 4.5:1 or higher

✅ Testing & Validation
Browsers Tested: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

Responsive Testing: Browser dev tools + physical devices

User Testing: Conducted 5 in-person tests, with feedback leading to improved CTA prominence and simplified mobile navigation

🧩 Challenges & Resolutions
Overlapping Hero Layout: Adjusted z-index and absolute positioning to improve stacking on mobile.

Heavy Carousel Library: Replaced with a custom lightweight solution, improving performance.

Font Loading Delays: Used font-display: swap and fallbacks to system fonts for instant content visibility.

🚀 Final Thoughts & Future Enhancements
The OneBite homepage delivers a flavorful user experience that combines strong branding with modern web standards. It’s performant, accessible, and engaging.

Looking Ahead:
Integration with live APIs for dynamic menu content

Authentication and personalized user flows

A/B testing for CTAs and layout variants
